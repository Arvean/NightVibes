# System Patterns

## Overview
This document describes the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, and component relationships.

## System Architecture
- Client-server architecture with a React Native mobile client and a Django/Python backend.
- RESTful API for communication between client and server.
- Database for storing user data, venue information, and other relevant data.
- Real-time communication using WebSockets or similar technology for notifications and updates.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Using React Native for cross-platform mobile development (iOS and Android).
- Using Django REST Framework for building the backend API.
- Choosing a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for data persistence.
- Implementing a robust authentication and authorization system.
- Using a task queue (e.g., Celery) for asynchronous tasks like sending notifications.

## Design Patterns in Use
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) on the client-side.
- Repository pattern for data access.
- Singleton pattern for managing global state and resources.
- Observer pattern for real-time updates and notifications.

## Component Relationships
- **Client:**
    - **Screens:** Represent different views and user interfaces (e.g., Login, Register, Home, Friend List, Venue Detail).
    - **Components:** Reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields, lists, cards).
    - **Services:** Handle API requests and data fetching.
    - **Context:** Manage global application state (e.g., user authentication, theme).
    - **Hooks:** Custom logic for managing state and side effects.
- **Server:**
    - **Models:** Define the data structure and database schema.
    - **Serializers:** Convert data between Python objects and JSON format.
    - **Views:** Handle API requests and business logic.
    - **URLs:** Map API endpoints to views.
    - **Tasks:** Asynchronous operations (e.g., sending notifications).
